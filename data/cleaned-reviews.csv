British Airways Business Class seats for the Club Europe product are terrible - exactly the same as Economy with the middle seat left vacant. You don't even get extra pitch.

22,22,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",1,2023-07-29,United Kingdom,True,ble experience british airway booked flight ba travel gibraltar london heathrow may flight scheduled leave p afternoon originally planned leaving luggage heathrow upon arrival travelling visit overnight cousin place en route gib airport hour prior departure checked flight detail found flight cancelled connecting flight booked westjet london heathrow vancouver following day make flight imperative got london checked ba website find flight would work unfortunately made mistake requesting refund managed find flight malaga got london p booked called british airway wanted discus compensation advised requested refund used phrase abandoned travel prepared anything apparently called first would made arrangement course explain website ask want refund proceed even plead case agent malaga airport followed customer relation several time via email flat refused budge used travel voucher cover cost flight used avios cover cost checked baggage word pocket cost trip incident happened ended spending euro airfare checked baggage charge get london malaga e different airport one originally booked luggage storage facility heathrow closed time eventually arrived ended booking night hotel since travel train cousin place longer bag tow want put drive airport pick cost another room meal cost ba ended compensate give free avios mere pittance compared pocket expense despite trying explain requested refund instead calling first budge easy say done since work know rule one scrambling find alternative travel arrangement within hour pointed website simply instruct customer call situation happens way would never encounter problem feeling put refund option hope customer make mistake wash hand situation ultimately save money executive club member year simply care said nothing could sure one ba executive friend family member gone staff would given instruction make thing right used fan ba really gone downhill opinion used remaining avios travel credit cancel executive club membership never fly

25,25,"✅ Trip Verified | I chose British Airways especially because I was going to travel with my niece and nephew, and wanted everything to work well. What a disaster! First, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problem. I also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a UK number from my Spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends. Then, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on. They just told us to wait. Finally we could access the plane. After 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled. We had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. Then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! We spent almost 12 hours at the airport. No information was provided, no solutions were offered. We had to seat in the last raw (when I had paid to seat on the first half of the plane).

27,27,"✅ Trip Verified | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.",1,2023-07-21,United Kingdom,True,simple story unfortunate outcome really could happen anyone partner recently started working studying purchased two ticket travel london city airport frankfurt purchased ticket mistakenly entered name twice e g mr john smith m john smith little know simple mistake would cost u pound upon arriving airport told way change name apparently change letter typo option purchase last remaining ticket wanted board flight price almost seven time higher original ticket zero empathy shown zero alternative offered trusting ba staff pretence apparently way could board flight bought ticket immediately purchased ticket contacted ba commercial change booking team informed situation service representative apologised told could changed name cost small fee offered cancel original ticket issue partial refund advising claim difference contact customer support told person several time wanted claim cost new ticket even asked explicitly accepting offer would denied claiming cost new ticket said could claim difference fair enough accepted offer lodged ticket customer support difference two day later british airway customer response informed u unable lodge claim voluntarily accepted cancellation flight continued send generic email week stopped responding short british airway misled deceived partner accepting lowball offer waive right claim refund keep night thinking get away easily
28,28,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes !

38,38,✅ Trip Verified |  I had the most fantastic BA Flight today. The cabin crew in my seat zone 6D were of the best I have experienced. Although the 777 had the old style rear/front seating - it was comfortable and felt open and spacious. BA have done great things with the menu - it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the pre-arrival meal into HKG at 1730PM local time having left London at 2200 the night before. The dinner offering was equally ample and delicious. The inflight entertainment had a great collection of TV and current films and the inflight map was first rate. Previously not a huge BA fan - but after this 12 hour flight I could only recommend it without reserve. I flew the new BA suite in J class on a recent Delhi to London flight and enjoyed that product (although I felt it slightly more cramped ) but I think BA have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way.

42,42,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",1,2023-07-29,United Kingdom,True,ble experience british airway booked flight ba travel gibraltar london heathrow may flight scheduled leave p afternoon originally planned leaving luggage heathrow upon arrival travelling visit overnight cousin place en route gib airport hour prior departure checked flight detail found flight cancelled connecting flight booked westjet london heathrow vancouver following day make flight imperative got london checked ba website find flight would work unfortunately made mistake requesting refund managed find flight malaga got london p booked called british airway wanted discus compensation advised requested refund used phrase abandoned travel prepared anything apparently called first would made arrangement course explain website ask want refund proceed even plead case agent malaga airport followed customer relation several time via email flat refused budge used travel voucher cover cost flight used avios cover cost checked baggage word pocket cost trip incident happened ended spending euro airfare checked baggage charge get london malaga e different airport one originally booked luggage storage facility heathrow closed time eventually arrived ended booking night hotel since travel train cousin place longer bag tow want put drive airport pick cost another room meal cost ba ended compensate give free avios mere pittance compared pocket expense despite trying explain requested refund instead calling first budge easy say done since work know rule one scrambling find alternative travel arrangement within hour pointed website simply instruct customer call situation happens way would never encounter problem feeling put refund option hope customer make mistake wash hand situation ultimately save money executive club member year simply care said nothing could sure one ba executive friend family member gone staff would given instruction make thing right used fan ba really gone downhill opinion used remaining avios travel credit cancel executive club membership never fly

First, it took me two hours to do the check-in online due to a technical problem. I also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a UK number from my Spanish cell phone because that’s the only service they provide on weekends. Then, at the airport, when there was the boarding time, we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on. They just told us to wait. Finally we could access the plane. After 40 minutes inside, they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled. We had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. Then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed! We spent almost 12 hours at the airport. No information was provided, no solutions were offered. We had to seat in the last raw (when I had paid to seat on the first half of the plane).

47,47,"✅ Trip Verified | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.",1,2023-07-21,United States,True,simple story unfortunate outcome really could happen anyone partner recently started working studying purchased two ticket travel london city airport frankfurt purchased ticket mistakenly entered name twice e g mr john smith m john smith little know simple mistake would cost u pound upon arriving airport told way change name apparently change letter typo option purchase last remaining ticket wanted board flight price almost seven time higher original ticket zero empathy shown zero alternative offered trusting ba staff pretence apparently way could board flight bought ticket immediately purchased ticket contacted ba commercial change booking team informed situation service representative apologised told could changed name cost small fee offered cancel original ticket issue partial refund advising claim difference contact customer support told person several time wanted claim cost new ticket even asked explicitly accepting offer would denied claiming cost new ticket said could claim difference fair enough accepted offer lodged ticket customer support difference two day later british airway customer response informed u unable lodge claim voluntarily accepted cancellation flight continued send generic email week stopped responding short british airway misled deceived partner accepting lowball offer waive right claim refund keep night thinking get away easily

We had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours. Then, do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off, which was again delayed!

67,67,"✅ Trip Verified | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.",1,2023-07-21,United Kingdom,True,simple story unfortunate outcome really could happen anyone partner recently started working studying purchased two ticket travel london city airport frankfurt purchased ticket mistakenly entered name twice e g mr john smith m john smith little know simple mistake would cost u pound upon arriving airport told way change name apparently change letter typo option purchase last remaining ticket wanted board flight price almost seven time higher original ticket zero empathy shown zero alternative offered trusting ba staff pretence apparently way could board flight bought ticket immediately purchased ticket contacted ba commercial change booking team informed situation service representative apologised told could changed name cost small fee offered cancel original ticket issue partial refund advising claim difference contact customer support told person several time wanted claim cost new ticket even asked explicitly accepting offer would denied claiming cost new ticket said could claim difference fair enough accepted offer lodged ticket customer support difference two day later british airway customer response informed u unable lodge claim voluntarily accepted cancellation flight continued send generic email week stopped responding short british airway misled deceived partner accepting lowball offer waive right claim refund keep night thinking get away easily

82,82,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion.

102,102,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",1,2023-07-29,United States,True,ble experience british airway booked flight ba travel gibraltar london heathrow may flight scheduled leave p afternoon originally planned leaving luggage heathrow upon arrival travelling visit overnight cousin place en route gib airport hour prior departure checked flight detail found flight cancelled connecting flight booked westjet london heathrow vancouver following day make flight imperative got london checked ba website find flight would work unfortunately made mistake requesting refund managed find flight malaga got london p booked called british airway wanted discus compensation advised requested refund used phrase abandoned travel prepared anything apparently called first would made arrangement course explain website ask want refund proceed even plead case agent malaga airport followed customer relation several time via email flat refused budge used travel voucher cover cost flight used avios cover cost checked baggage word pocket cost trip incident happened ended spending euro airfare checked baggage charge get london malaga e different airport one originally booked luggage storage facility heathrow closed time eventually arrived ended booking night hotel since travel train cousin place longer bag tow want put drive airport pick cost another room meal cost ba ended compensate give free avios mere pittance compared pocket expense despite trying explain requested refund instead calling first budge easy say done since work know rule one scrambling find alternative travel arrangement within hour pointed website simply instruct customer call situation happens way would never encounter problem feeling put refund option hope customer make mistake wash hand situation ultimately save money executive club member year simply care said nothing could sure one ba executive friend family member gone staff would given instruction make thing right used fan ba really gone downhill opinion used remaining avios travel credit cancel executive club membership never fly

107,107,"✅ Trip Verified | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund.

For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work.

117,117,"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been by far the worst service I have had on a plane. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes.

120,120,"✅ Trip Verified |  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure.

British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges.

127,127,"Not Verified |  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience.

131,131,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules.

(I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"".

147,147,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there.

158,158,"Not Verified |  My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked.

161,161,"Not Verified | Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU.

Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips.

I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times.

173,173,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways.

There are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being told.

177,177,"Not Verified | Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service.

178,178,"Not Verified | I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations.

Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive.

186,186,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew.

187,187,"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays.

The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse.

201,201,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough.

202,202,"Not Verified | Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey... On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in Amsterdam?

Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab, and I left.

Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option.

221,221,"✅ Trip Verified |  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane.

222,222,Not Verified |  Lost my case and took 6 weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after 8 weeks.

SAS Airlines left Manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control. When I arrived in Copenhagen to get the connecting flight for Bangkok we were 10 minutes too late and the flight had gone (half of the plane missed it).. SAS Airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being … Copenhagen (SAS) > London (BA) > Dubai (Emirates) > Bangkok. I returned from Copenhagen to London and the collected my boarding pass at BA. We were over 2 hours late leaving London due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight. We arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had gone. Emirates then informed me that I had to speak with Thai Air to get another flight issued. I spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phone. I then spoke with Thai Air Dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that I buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later. I paid £1279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight out of Dubai > Kuwaiti > Bangkok. Whilst in Dubai I checked with Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from London and they would locate it and forward to my Bangkok address the following day.

224,224,"✅ Trip Verified |  Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before.

240,240,"✅ Trip Verified |  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight.

Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out.

I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.

255,255,"Not Verified |  As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned.

260,260,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible.

261,261,"Not Verified |  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.

263,263,"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height.

271,271,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves.

277,277,"Not Verified |  Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet.

279,279,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff.

So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate.

305,305,"✅ Trip Verified |  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys.",3,2022-10-25,United States,True,year ago flying ba enjoyable time changed day five hour board plane fun terminal experience still feel classy way felt well staffed efficient board though become experience endured ba mean decision split seat nicer first half plane nastier rest underline entertainment magazine refreshment purchase brought seat ordering app attempt provide fresh hot food day despite competition able much ask trapped board five hour get free tiny bottle water small cereal bar outbound flight crew collected rubbish landing helpfully tied bag around toilet door back case anyone wanted fight way past clear thing recline button deleted seat seat pitch feel squeezed return flight one reason another due ba delay previous day two hour late getting plane late evening passenger travel enough crew cabin crew nonetheless distinctly professional flight altogether would say good thing hard think anything could recommend ba pity used professional company deal pleasure worth looking forward making european journey

They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good.

309,309,"✅ Trip Verified |  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again.

First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come.

349,349,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

350,350,"Not Verified |  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight.

352,352,"✅ Trip Verified |  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris.

I call every 2-3 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation. I will never book with BA again. Sure, flying with them is easy, but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time. And to think I spent more money on a ticket with BA than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier.

359,359,"Not Verified |  Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag. I hadn't flown BA in many years and with experience I would never book them again.",1,2022-07-06,United Kingdom,False,verified today husband friend flew dublin london city airport apparently went well check flight ineptitude lack system seemed full bloom waited waited bag come baggage carriage neither husband mine came found ba service person help told bag checked plane thought one bag made two customer flight complaining someone else gotten bag assumed kind interesting fiction told file claim ba com time hour flight landed system say idea bag bag get flight le le airline tracked bag fastidiously usually fly united airline track bag every stage flight updated info e g bag loaded onto plane bag way baggage claim ba seem anything like case appears ba cannot even locate bag flown ba many year experience would never book

361,361,"Not Verified |  I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent Flyer points. I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles. When I asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation, they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable. I read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable.",1,2022-07-04,Switzerland,False,verified booked flight wife heathrow nairobi premium economy using frequent flyer point paid reserve two seat configuration cabin want sit row people possible week flight ba emailed say changed seat selection logged see new seat selection moved row email also stated happy new seat selection made could get full refund money paid called cancel reservation paid cancelation fee refunded frequent flyer mile asked refund fee seat reservation told seat reservation fee non refundable read email sent changed reserved seat repeated seat reservation always non refundable
362,362,"✅ Trip Verified |  Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. I am going to explore other options before using BA again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport.",6,2022-06-30,Australia,True,departure minute late flew eighteen month old seating spacing economy class seems tight seat front fully tilted back real challenge get seat screen becomes close face becomes difficult focus screen audio poor due music drowning conversation gave trying watch cabin crew seemed really struggle service felt disorganised felt sorry cabin crew seemed working hard seems lot aisle type aircraft felt unnatural overhead bin high many passenger difficulty accessing belonging flight tried using overhead attendant light verify wife meal one responds better stop flight attendant aisle nice aircraft two hour flight fun close eleven hour going explore option using ba hassle make contact anybody flight put even go airport

366,366,"Not Verified |  We left MIA late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane. We arrived late and so missed our connection at LHR to CDG. At LHR British Airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to CDG and as such said I never took the flight to CDG and then cancelled my flight back to MIA since I did not take my flight. They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I never took it. Thus I had to book on another airline to return at the last moment. Trying to call BA was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped.

Then, they could miss my two suitcases, plus the luggage of my boyfriend, who traveled with me. After 3 days, they delivered 2 of our 3 bags, and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists. Now, already 10 days passed, and still no information of where the last suitcase is.

369,369,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022. Your claim's been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason.

We take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision.
